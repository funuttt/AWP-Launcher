AWP Executor is a third-party tool used to run custom scripts in Roblox games, allowing users to modify gameplay or add cheats. It supports executing Lua scripts, often enabling features like auto-farming, flying, or wallhacks. While popular among exploiters, using AWP Executor violates Robloxâ€™s Terms of Service and poses security risks.
